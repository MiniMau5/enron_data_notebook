enron  data notebook
The goal of this project is to build a person of interest identifier for the Enron scandal using the database provided. 

The dataset consists of a data dictionary with the employee’s name as the Key and then data for each of the following info points:
'poi', 'salary', 'bonus', 'deferral_payments', 'total_payments', 'loan_advances', 'restricted_stock_deferred', 'deferred_income', 
'total_stock_value', 'expenses', 'exercised_stock_options', 'long_term_incentive', 'restricted_stock', 'director_fees', 
'shared_receipt_with_poi’

By using the information that we have- especially the hand generated list of POIs, indicating whether each person is considered a POI 
or not-  then using the data – to train our algorithm, the final algorithm could be potentially used on more data to determine people 
who should be investigated as they have a high potential of being a person of interest in the Enron scandal. One can then find other 
features and values that can point to the POI.
